Hello, i made web app projact for book web shop. 

Tech Stach: .NET Core, C#, HTML, CSS, MVC, Microsoft Identity, Sqlite

I posted a video on youtube about my web app on this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aP17hIUuqs

There are two sides of app usings (as an customer and as an admin or employee) as i explained in first video.
From customer side your permssions is to register, loging, add  product to chart, manage numbers of items in cart or delete them, order products and make a peyment using Stripe payment.
As an employee or admin role you can manage (CRUD operations) products, categories, covertypes, companies, manage orders (payment status, ordes status).
